# MoveVR
MoveVR is a plugin for the X-Plane flight simulator that allows bringing 2D desktop windows into the cockpit's VR environment, for example to use a web browser while in VR.

It also includes some hacks to add VR support to plugin windows of other X-Plane plugins, for example to add VR-touch capabilities to VR-ignorant aircraft.
